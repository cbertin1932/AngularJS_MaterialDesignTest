Here is a AngularJS project that takes input from an XML files and generates a card or table view. These views can be switched between. The is also a search bar that searches by name. The project also uses material design for greater visual appeal.

I would also like to apologize for the delay. I missed the message in my email. With the New Year it has been very full, but that is no excuse.
